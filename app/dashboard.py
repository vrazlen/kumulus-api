Welcome to the KUMULUS prototype dashboard. This tool uses a U-Net deep learning model

    As outlined in our project's guiding principles, it is critical to use this technology responsibly.
    * **Purpose:** This tool is designed for analysis and planning to support equitable urban development, not for surveillance or punitive action.
    * **Accuracy:** The model's predictions are based on visual patterns and are not a definitive ground truth. They are subject to errors and should be field-verified by local experts.
    * **Bias:** The training data is from a specific region and time. The model's performance may vary significantly in different geographic contexts or seasons.
    * **Community Engagement:** True validation and responsible use require partnership with the communities depicted in this data. This dashboard is a starting point for dialogue, not a final judgment.
